🛢️ Shell.ai Fuel Blend Property Prediction
📌 Overview

This project was developed as part of the Shell.ai Fuel Blend Property Prediction Challenge, a global machine learning competition focused on predicting fuel blend properties using real-world chemical composition data.

The objective was to build a high-accuracy regression model capable of generalizing well to unseen fuel blends while handling complex feature interactions.

🎯 Problem Statement

Given the chemical composition of fuel blends, predict key fuel properties accurately using machine learning techniques.
The challenge emphasizes feature engineering, model robustness, and predictive accuracy under real-world constraints.

🧠 Approach & Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Handled missing and zero-value features

Applied normalization and scaling where required

Split data into training and validation sets

2️⃣ Feature Engineering

Generated meaningful derived features from blend components

Removed redundant and low-importance features

Experimented with statistical and domain-inspired feature combinations

3️⃣ Model Development

Trained regression models using:

Gradient Boosting / Tree-based models

Ensemble techniques for improved generalization

Performed hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation

4️⃣ Evaluation Strategy

Used validation-based evaluation to prevent overfitting

Monitored accuracy and error metrics across iterations

📊 Results

Achieved a final model accuracy of 90.8%

Secured 53rd rank on the global Shell.ai leaderboard

Demonstrated consistent performance across validation splits
